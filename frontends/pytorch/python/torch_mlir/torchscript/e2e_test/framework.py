# End-to-end testing framework for TorchScript.

For the purposes of this framework, "end to end" means the first "end" is
a `torch.nn.Module`, and the second "end" is execution.

## Architecture

A program for this testing framework is considered to be a `torch.nn.Module`,
which has a public interface consisting of its methods and instance attributes.

A test in the framework consists conceputally of a list of calls into
the methods of a module (TODO: extend to instance attributes). It is expected
that the outputs match between the program run on a backend (controlled by
a TestConfig) and a golden trace obtained by running on native Torch (without
compiling or TorchScript'ing).

class TestConfig(abc.ABC):
    """The interface implemented by backends to run tests.

    The testing framework expects to be able to call `compile` to compile
    a torch.nn.Module, and then pass the compiled artifact to `run` to run it.

    Note that the definition of "compiled artifact" here is quite loose, and
    this interface allows for many different use cases besides simple testing.

    For example, this interface can be overridden to be a "data collector"
    to gather information across all the test cases. For example,
    a compiler backend could override "compile" to just return some IR at a
    useful intermediate abstraction level (rather than the final compiled
    artifact), and then have "run" save this intermediate IR + the trace as
    input to some lower-level software stack's testing format.

    The set of TestConfig's is expected to be pluggable and provided by
    users to suit their own needs. We provide a few configs out of the box
    in the `configs` submodule of this package, but those are intended
    to be for basic inspiration and enough for our own testing.
    Backends to npcomp will likely have more elaborate TestConfig's, such
    as `compile` being "compile for such-and-such DSP with these vectorization
    cost model flags" and `run` being "connect to Android phone with
    device ID 1234 and upload a program to run on it's DSP core, and also set
    power throttling settings to 'performance'".

    That is also why this class is not called "backend", as it
    encapsulates potentially many specific details of the test configuration
    process as well. There isn't a general way to disentangle test configuration
    from the compile/run process specific to a logical backend, since each
    backend (compiler backend and runtime target) will have an arbitrarily
    wild and wonderful set of possible configurations that we cannot predict.

        populated should be returned.

        multiple parallel invocations of `run`, and so it should not be mutated.
        This property is typicaly trivially satisfied for a true
        "compiled artifact", but some backends don't directly involve a
