def _get_decomposition_table():
    """Get a decomposition table suitable for Torch-MLIR.

    Sometimes TorchDynamo traces slightly different ops than what TorchScript
    captures. Historically we have been driven by the ops captured by
    TorchScript, so we try to decompose the ops captured by TorchDynamo into
    other ops that we already support.

    There isn't a highly principled solution here. Torch-MLIR currently supports
    a somewhat random set of ops, added in a demand-driven way over time,
    including direct backend support and decompositions internal to Torch-MLIR.
    As described in the
    [long-term roadmap](https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir/blob/main/docs/long_term_roadmap.md),
    eventually this situation is expected to be made a lot more principled
    by aligning more with how Torch-MLIR would have looked if some of the new
    upstream PyTorch infra had been available at the beginning -- in particular
    the new decomposition infra and PrimTorch.
