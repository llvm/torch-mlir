### Additional end-to-end tests with heavy dependencies (heavydep tests)

Some end-to-end tests require additional dependencies which don't make sense to
include as part of the default npcomp setup. Additionally, these dependencies
often don't work with the same HEAD PyTorch version that npcomp builds against
at the C++ level.

We have a self-contained script that generates all the needed artifacts from a
self-contained virtual environment. It can be used like so:

```shell
# Build the virtual environment in the specified directory and generate the
# serialized test artifacts in the other specified directory.
# This command is safe to re-run if you have already built the virtual
# environment and just changed the tests.
build_tools/torchscript_e2e_heavydep_tests/generate_serialized_tests.sh \
  path/to/heavydep_venv \
  path/to/heavydep_serialized_tests

# Add the --serialized-test-dir flag to point at the directory containing the
# serialized tests. All other functionality is the same as the normal invocation
# of torchscript_e2e_test.sh, but the serialized tests will be available.
tools/torchscript_e2e_test.sh --serialized-test-dir=path/to/heavydep_serialized_tests
```

The tests use the same (pure-Python) test framework as the normal
torchscript_e2e_test.sh, but the tests are added in
`build_tools/torchscript_e2e_heavydep_tests` instead of
`frontends/pytorch/e2e_testing/torchscript`.

We rely critically on serialized TorchScript compatibility across PyTorch
versions to transport the tests + pure-Python compatibility of the `torch`
API, which has worked well so far.
