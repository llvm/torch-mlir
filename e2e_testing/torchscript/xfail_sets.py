# This file describes the sets of tests expected to fail for each config.
# This information is deliberately kept in a side table, rather than
# in-situ on the test, as a deliberate layering decision: tests should
# have unique keys to identify them and enable side tables of various kinds
# (this includes down into lower parts of the stack, where a side table
# might be used to keep more elaborate sets of testing configurations).

# Lists of tests that fail to even reach the backends.
# These represent further work needed in torch-mlir to lower them properly
# to the backend contract.
