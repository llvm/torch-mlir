# 2021Q4 Roadmap

**NOTE**: Under construction. Feedback from the
[Torch-MLIR RFC](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/torch-mlir-bridging-pytorch-and-mlir-ecosystems/133151)
is expected to influence this!

1. Demonstrate viability of our solutions on industry-standard workloads:
    - {inference, training} x {BERT-L, MaskRCNN, ResNet50}
1. One industry partner migrates (or begins to migrate) to Torch-MLIR for an e2e
   flow on their critical path.
1. Torch-MLIR is seen/accepted as an "off the shelf" solution for Torch/MLIR
   interop. This specifically covers "softer" / "quasi-technical" aspects of the
   project, such as community outreach/recognition, build system integration,
   testing, CI, packaging, documentation.
