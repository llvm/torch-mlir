### How to TorchToLinalg

You will need to do 5 things:

- make sure -DTORCH_MLIR_ENABLE_JIT_IR_IMPORTER=ON is added during build. This is to enable the python file used in `build_tools/update_torch_ods.sh` and `build_tools/update_abstract_interp_lib.sh`
- make sure the op exists in `torch_ods_gen.py`, and then run `build_tools/update_torch_ods.sh`, and then build. This generates `GeneratedTorchOps.td`, which is used to generate the cpp and h files where ops function signatures are defined.
  - Reference [torch op registry](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/7451dd058564b5398af79bfc1e2669d75f9ecfa2/torch/csrc/jit/passes/utils/op_registry.cpp#L21)
- make sure the op exists in `abstract_interp_lib_gen.py`, and then run `build_tools/update_abstract_interp_lib.sh`, and then build. This generates `AbstractInterpLib.cpp`, which is used to generate the cpp and h files where ops function signatures are defined.
  - Reference [torch shape functions](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/7451dd058564b5398af79bfc1e2669d75f9ecfa2/torch/jit/_shape_functions.py#L1311)
- write test cases. They live in `projects/pt1`. See the [Dec 2023 example](https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir/pull/2640/files).
- implement the op in one of the `lib/Conversion/TorchToLinalg/*.cpp` files

### How to TorchOnnxToTorch

1. Generate the big folder of ONNX IR. Use [this Python script](https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir/blob/main/test/python/onnx_importer/import_smoke_test.py). Alternatively, if you're trying to support a certain model, convert that model to onnx IR with

   ```shell
   optimum-cli export onnx --model facebook/opt-125M fb-opt
   python -m torch_mlir.tools.import_onnx fb-opt/model.onnx -o fb-opt-125m.onnx.mlir
   ```

1. Find an instance of the Op that you're trying to implement inside the smoke tests folder or the generated model IR, and write a test case. Later you will save it to one of the files in `torch-mlir/test/Conversion/TorchOnnxToTorch`, but for now feel free to put it anywhere.
1. Implement the op in `lib/Conversion/TorchOnnxToTorch/something.cpp`.
1. Test the conversion by running `./build/bin/torch-mlir-opt -split-input-file -verify-diagnostics -convert-torch-onnx-to-torch your_mlir_file.mlir`. For more details, see [the testing section of the doc on development](https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir/blob/main/docs/development.md#testing). Xida usually creates a separate MLIR file to test it to his satisfaction before integrating it into one of the files at `torch-mlir/test/Conversion/TorchOnnxToTorch`.

## List of Tools you may need to use (this will be incorporated into the above instructions later)

- Generate FILECHECK tests from MLIR test cases: `torch-mlir-opt -convert-<your conversion> /tmp/your_awesome_testcase.mlir | externals/llvm-project/mlir/utils/generate-test-checks.py
`. Please don't just paste the generated tests - reference them to write your own

## How to set up vs code and intellisence for [torch-mlir]

Xida: This is optional. If you're using VS code like me, you might want to set it up so you can use the jump to definition / references, auto fix, and other features.

Feel free to contact me on discord if you have trouble figuring this out.

You may need to write something like this into your

```.vscode/settings.json```

under `torch-mlir`

```json
{
    "files.associations": {
        "*.inc": "cpp",
        "ranges": "cpp",
        "regex": "cpp",
        "functional": "cpp",
        "chrono": "cpp",
        "__functional_03": "cpp",
        "target": "cpp"
    },
    "cmake.sourceDirectory": ["/home/xida/torch-mlir/externals/llvm-project/llvm"],
    "cmake.buildDirectory": "${workspaceFolder}/build",
    "cmake.generator": "Ninja",
    "cmake.configureArgs": [
        "-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=mlir",
        "-DLLVM_EXTERNAL_PROJECTS=\"torch-mlir\"",
        "-DLLVM_EXTERNAL_TORCH_MLIR_SOURCE_DIR=\"/home/xida/torch-mlir\"",
        "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release",
        "-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache",
        "-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache",
        "-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=mlir",
        "-DLLVM_EXTERNAL_PROJECTS=torch-mlir",
        "-DLLVM_EXTERNAL_TORCH_MLIR_SOURCE_DIR=${workspaceFolder}",
        "-DMLIR_ENABLE_BINDINGS_PYTHON=ON",
        "-DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON",
        "-DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=host",
    ],
    "C_Cpp.default.configurationProvider": "ms-vscode.cmake-tools",
    "cmake.configureEnvironment": {
        "PATH": "/home/xida/miniconda/envs/torch-mlir/bin:/home/xida/miniconda/condabin:/home/xida/miniconda/bin:/home/xida/miniconda/bin:/home/xida/miniconda/condabin:/home/xida/miniconda/bin:/home/xida/miniconda/bin:/home/xida/miniconda/condabin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin"
    },
    "cmake.cmakePath": "/home/xida/miniconda/envs/torch-mlir/bin/cmake", // make sure this is a cmake that knows where your python is
}
```

The important things to note are the `cmake.configureArgs`, which specify the location of your torch mlir, and the `cmake.sourceDirectory`, which indicates that CMAKE should not build from the current directory and should instead build from `externals/llvm-project/llvm`
